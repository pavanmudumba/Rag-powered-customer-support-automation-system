Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways.
It leads to difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness.

Asthma symptoms may vary from mild to severe and can be triggered by allergens, air pollution, exercise, cold air, or respiratory infections.
Some individuals experience asthma attacks that require immediate medical attention.

Diagnosis of asthma involves reviewing medical history, lung function tests, and identifying triggers.
There is no cure for asthma, but symptoms can be effectively managed.

Asthma treatment includes the use of inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and avoiding known triggers.
Patients are advised to follow an asthma action plan provided by healthcare professionals.

Proper asthma management improves quality of life and reduces the risk of severe attacks.
