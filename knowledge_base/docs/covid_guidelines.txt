COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, and shortness of breath.
Some individuals may experience severe illness, particularly older adults and those with underlying medical conditions.

Preventive measures include wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, practicing hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded places.
Vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalization.

People experiencing symptoms should isolate themselves and seek medical advice.
Testing is recommended to confirm infection and prevent further spread.

Public health guidelines emphasize vaccination, early detection, and community awareness to control COVID-19 transmission.
