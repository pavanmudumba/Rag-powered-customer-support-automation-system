Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the force of blood against artery walls is consistently too high.
It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke.

Most individuals with hypertension do not experience noticeable symptoms, which is why it is often called a silent disease.
In severe cases, symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath.

Hypertension is diagnosed by measuring blood pressure levels.
Normal blood pressure is typically below 120/80 mmHg.
Sustained readings above this range indicate hypertension.

Management of hypertension includes lifestyle changes such as reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, managing stress, avoiding tobacco use, and limiting alcohol consumption.
Medications like ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics may be prescribed depending on severity.

Controlling blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, kidney damage, and stroke.
