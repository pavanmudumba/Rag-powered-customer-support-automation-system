Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels.
It occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.

Common symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, excessive thirst, increased hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow healing of wounds.
Some individuals may also experience tingling or numbness in hands and feet.

There are two major types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells.
Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin resistance and is often linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity and physical inactivity.

Management of diabetes includes monitoring blood glucose levels, following a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and taking medications such as insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs.
Early diagnosis and proper management help prevent complications like heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss.

Patients with diabetes are advised to limit sugar intake, maintain a healthy weight, and follow medical guidance regularly.
